NAME
       plan - path analysis tool

       Part of Tina Toolbox for analysis of Petri nets and Time Petri nets.


SYNOPSIS
       plan [-help]
            [-A | -S] [-t s] [-p]
            [-NET | -NDR | -PNML | -TPN | -TTS]
            [-v | -q | -s] [-abs | -rel] [-raw | -min | -can]
            [scninfile] [netinfile] [outfile] [errorfile]


DESCRIPTION
       From  a Time Petri net or  Time Transition System and a firing sequence
       in .scn format, plan  computes an inequation system characterizing  all
       the  times at which transitions in the sequence may fire, or an example
       firing schedule (also called path).


OPTIONS
       -help  Recalls options.


       Operating mode options:


       -A     Returns  an  inequation  system   characterizing  the  times  at
              which transition in the input .scn firing sequence may fire.  If
              the  input firing sequence is timed, then  times are  forgotten.
              Fails if the input firing sequence is not firable.


       -S     Returns a solution of the system computed by -A.


       Path options:


       -abs   Returns   path  system   or  path  expressed in  terms of  dates
              (absolute times). Variable  start is  the  time  at   which  the
              initial  marking is established.


       -rel   Returns   path  system   or path  expressed in  terms of  delays
              (relative times).



       -raw   Returns path system "as computed", without any  particular  post
              processing.


       -can   Returns  path  system  in  which  all constraints are tight. All
              missing constraints, if any, are redundant and can be  recovered
              as linear combinations of the existing constraints.


       -min   (IN  PROGRESS)  As -can, except that attempts to return a system
              without redundant constraints.


       Output format flags:


       -v     verbose output. Prints results in explicit form.


       -q     Prints a summary of results. For -A, and when -can  or  -min  is
              passed,  prints  the duration of the shortest and longest paths.
              For -S, prints the duration of the path computed.


       -s     Output results in a format loadable into  the  nd  stepper,  for
              replaying it (only for mode -S).


       Other flags:


       -p     Disables path analysis (just parses).




       Input format flags for net:


       -NET | -NDR | -PNML | -TPN | -TTS
              Specifies  the  format  of the input net. This flag is necessary
              when the input net is read on standard input,  or  read  from  a
              file  that does not bear the expected extension. By default, the
              net is assumed in .net or .ndr format.



       Firing sequence input source:


       scninfile
              Where the firing  sequence is read. If absent  or  specified  by
              "-", the sequence is read on  standard input.


       Net input source:


       netinfile
              Where  the   net  is   read. The  input format is  determined by
              the file type, according to the table below. If absent or speci-
              fied  by  "-",  and the firing sequence is not read  on standard
              input, the net is read on standard input in  the  format  speci-
              fied  by  the input  flag. If both an infile and some input flag
              are present, then the format defined by the  input  flag  super-
              sedes that determined by the infile extension.

              file extension      input format
              --------------------------------------------------------------
              .net           net format
              .ndr           ndr format
              .tpn           tpn format
              .pnml               pnml format
              .tts           tts format



       Output destination:


       outfile
              Where  results  are  written. The output format is determined by
              the file type, according  to the  table  below.  If   absent  or
              specified   by  "-", then the net is written on  standard output
              in the format specified by the output  format flag. If both   an
              outfile  and  some   output  flag  are present, then  the format
              defined  by the output flag  supersedes that determined  by  the
              outfile extension.

              file extension      output format
              --------------------------------------------------------------
              .scn           nd stepper format
              any other      textual output (default -v style)


       Errors destination:


       errorfile
              Where error messages are written. By default, errors are printed
              on standard error.


       Default options:

              plan -A -v



EXAMPLES
       plan -A nets/ifip.scn nets/ifip.ndr
       plan -S nets/ifip.scn nets/ifip.ndr -s
       cat nets/ifip.scn | plan -S - nets/ifip.ndr



NOTES
       Tool plan is  still in progress; more options to come.
