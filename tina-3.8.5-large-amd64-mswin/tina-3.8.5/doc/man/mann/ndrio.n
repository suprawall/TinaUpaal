.SH DESCRIPTION

ndrio converts Petri nets and Time Petri nets between several, graphic
or textual, formats. ndrio handles tina labels, delay intervals associated
with transitions, generalized inhibitor and read (test) arcs, generalized
stopwatch-inhibitor and stopwatch arcs, and priorities.
The features not supported by the target format are silently omitted.
The formats manipulated are the following:

.nf
name		extension       description
------------------------------------------------------
net             \&.net          tina textual format
ndr             \&.ndr          tina graphic format (produced by nd)
tpn             \&.tpn          tina textual scripts format
pnml            \&.pnml         Petri Net Markup Language format
                                (with or without graphics)
pnt             \&.pnt          INA format
                                (if the net is timed, the intervals
                                 are saved into a companion \&.tim file)
romeo           \&.romeo        romeo format (without graphics)
lola            \&.lola         LoLA format (unstructured)
nupn            \&.nupn         CADP nupn format
.fi


The conversions currently supported are the following:

.nf

------------------------------------------------------
net             ndr, tpn, pnml, pnt, romeo, lola, nupn
ndr             net, tpn, pnml, pnt, romeo, lola, nupn
tpn             net, ndr, pnml, pnt, romeo, lola, nupn
pnml            net, ndr, tpn, pnml, pnt, romeo, lola, nupn

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\-\f2h\f1elp
Recalls options.

.TP
.B Input format flags:

.TP
\-NET | -NDR | -PNML | -TPN
Specifies the format of the input net. This flag is necessary when the
input net is read on standard input, or read from a file that does not
bear the expected extension. Default is -NET.

.TP
.B Output format flags:

.TP
\-net | -ndr | -pnml | -tpn | -pnt | -romeo | -lola | -nupn
Specifies the  format of the output  net. This flag  is necessary when
the output net  is written on standard output, or into a file that does
not bear the expected extension.

Export to romeo and lola is preliminary. The graphic information, if any,
is currently not exported to romeo. Also, the user should make sure the
place and transition names used in the input file are legal romeo or
lola names; ndrio does not attempt to convert them (consider passing options
-r -d, in addition).

Export to nupn converts pnml format, with or without nupn units descriptions,
to CADP nupn format. If the input file format is not pnml, or there are no
unit descriptions in the file, or if option -no-nupn is passed, outputs a file
in nupn format in which all units are trivial (each contains a single place).
In all cases, the input net is assumed safe.


.TP
.B Secondary pnml output flags:

.TP
\-tpnty | \-ptty | \-mcc
By default (\-tpnty), ndrio generates pnml in the "tpn" profile proper to TINA.
With \-ptty, it generates pnml conformimg to the Place/Transition profile. That is temporal interval,
special arcs, labels, notes are dropped from the input.
With \-mcc, in addition, it generates pnml obeying the Model Checking Contest convention
that the xml id's of the nodes are equal to their pnml name.

.TP
.B Drawing options:

.TP
\-graphplace | -dot | -neato | -circo
Specify a placement filter for nodes. Necessary when converting from a
graphics-free format  into \&.ndr; optional when converting  into \&.pnml
(graphics information is only  generated if some filter is specified).
When  converting  from  a   graphic  format,  the  original  placement
information is always retained, whatever the tool specified.

.TP
.B Textifying option:

.TP
\-textify
Removes any graphics information from the input file when graphics is
supported but optional in the output format.


.TP
.B Other flags:

.TP
\-no-nupn
If the input file is in pnml format, forget any nupn units descriptions in it.

.TP
\-ren | \-r
Renames places and transitions with integers prefixed by "p" and "t", respectively.
Old names become labels.

.TP
\-d
Drops all labels of places and transitions.

.TP
\-mcc
When converting a net to pnml format, ndrio generates unique xml ids for places ans transitions. With option-mcc xml ids are taken as names given to these nodes. The conversion fails if some name is not a syntactically  legal xml id, in which case you may wish to rename the net first by -ren -d.

.TP
\-rev
Reverses the direction of normal edges (inhibitor, read, stopwatch,
stopwatch-inhibitor and priority edges are unchanged).

.TP
\-transpose | \-t
When the output format is .net, prints the .net description "by place" instead of
the default "per transition" presentation.

.TP
.B Input source:

.TP
infile
Where the  net is  read. The  input format is  determined by  the file
type, according to the table above. If absent or specified by "-", the
net is  read on standard  input in the  format specified by  the input
flag. If  both an  infile and  some input flag  are present,  then the
format defined  by the  input flag supersedes  that determined  by the
infile extension.

.TP
.B Output destination:

.TP
outfile
Where the net is written. The output format is determined by the file
type, according  to the  table above. If  absent or specified  by "-",
then the net is written on standard output in the format specified by
the output flag. If both an  outfile and some output flag are present,
then the format defined by  the output flag supersedes that determined
by the outfile extension.

.TP
.B Errors destination:

.TP
errorfile
Where error messages are written. By default, errors are printed on standard error.
